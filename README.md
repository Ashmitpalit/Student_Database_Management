# Student_Database_Management
This a mini project developed using C programming language and concept of file handling that allows the user to store, append and view a file which has been used to manage a student database. 

File handling refers to the method of storing data in the form of an output or input that might have been generated while running a program in a data file.

Using the concept of switch-case I have enabled the user to either create a new file(database), append to an existing file, check whether a student is enrollled already to the list or not and even view the exisiting file.
